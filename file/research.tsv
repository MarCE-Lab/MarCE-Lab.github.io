However, the development of an efficient design methodology still remains challenging due to highly intensive search in the design space required by the conventional optimization-based approaches. To address this issue, this study develops two machine learning (ML)-based approaches for the design of one-dimensional periodic and non-periodic metamaterial systems. For periodic metamaterials, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach is proposed to design a metamaterial that can achieve user-defined frequency band gaps. This RL-based approach surpasses conventional optimization-based methods in the reduction of computation cost when a near-optimal solution is acceptable. Leveraging the capability of exploration in RL, the proposed approach does not require any training datasets generation and therefore can be deployed for online metamaterial design. For non-periodic metamaterials, a neural network (NN)-based approach capable of learning the behavior of individual material units is presented. By assembling the NN representation of individual material units, a surrogate model of the whole metamaterial is employed to determine the properties of the resulting assembly. Interestingly, the proposed approach is capable of modeling different metamaterial assemblies satisfying user-defined properties while requiring only a one-time network training procedure. Also, the NN-based approach does not need a pre-defined number of material unit cells, and it works when the physical model of the unit cell is not well understood, or the situation where only the sensor measurements of the unit cell are available. The robustness of the proposed two approaches is validated through numerical simulations and design examples.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-020-02819-6	Rih-Teng Wu	Metamaterial

Being formulated as inverse problems, all these applications share as a common denominator the need for efficient solution methodologies. Available techniques, mostly based on conventional optimization approaches, have shown some significant limitations in terms of the ability to explore a vast design space and to limit the computation burden. In this study, a novel deep auto-encoder (DAE) based approach is proposed in order to solve a benchmark inverse problem consisting in designing assemblies of acoustic scattering elements capable of molding an incoming plane wave into a target (user-defined) downstream pressure distribution. The proposed approach is validated numerically through three design scenarios, involving either a single or multiple scatterer configuration, and target pressure fields defined at different frequencies. The proposed network consists of a geometry estimator and a DAE that imposes constraints due to the physics of the problem on the geometry estimator during the learning process which leads to more robust design. By joint optimization, the estimation of scatterer geometry is strengthened with the latent representations of the target pressure field learned by the DAE. For a trained network, the design inference is quasi-instantaneous given a target 2D pressure field. The generalization capability of the proposed network is further explored by using a dataset generated based on scatterers having new shapes.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327021005665	Rih-Teng Wu	Metamaterial

Phononic metamaterials with a frequency band gap can effectively block elastic waves in certain frequency ranges, but often require a tedious trial-and-error design process. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competence in solving various inverse problems. This study proposes a deeplearning-based workflow for phononic plate metamaterial design. The Mindlin plate formulation was used to expedite the forward calculations, and the neural network was trained for inverse design. We showed that, with only 360 sets of data for training and testing, the neural network attained a 2% error in achieving the target band gap, by optimizing five design parameters. The designed metamaterial plate showed a -1 dB/mm omnidirectional attenuation for flexural waves around 3 kHz.	https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/5/1879	Rih-Teng Wu	Metamaterial

However, current inspection practices are time consuming, tedious, and subjective: they involve an operator manually locating cracks in metallic surfaces in the plant by watching videos. At the same time, prevalent automatic crack detection algorithms may not detect cracks in metallic surfaces because these are typically very small and have low contrast. Moreover, the existences of scratches, welds, and grind marks lead to a large number of false positives when state-of-the-art vision based crack detection algorithms are used. In this study, a novel crack detection approach is proposed based on local binary patterns (LBP), support vector machine (SVM), and Bayesian decision theory. The proposed method aggregates the information obtained from different video frames to enhance the robustness and reliability of detection. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed by using several inspection videos. The results indicate that it is accurate and robust in cases where state-of-the-art crack detection approaches fail. The experiments show that Bayesian data fusion improves the hit rate by 20% and the hit rate achieves 85% with only one false positive per frame.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mice.12256	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial

In the MDOF system, roof acceleration is estimated through the input ground motion. Various cases of noise-contaminated signals are considered in this study, and the conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm serves as a reference for the proposed CNN approach. According to the results from numerical simulations and experimental data, the proposed CNN approach is able to predict the structural responses accurately, and it is more robust against noisy data compared with the MLP algorithm. Moreover, the physical interpretation of CNN model is discussed in the context of structural dynamics. It is demonstrated that in some special cases, the convolution kernel has the capability of approximating the numerical integration operator, and the convolution layers attempt to extract the dominant frequency signature observed in the ideal target signal while eliminating irrelevant information during the training process.	https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29EM.1943-7889.0001556	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial

Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes façade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.	 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/stc.2507	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial

The quality of inspection relies on the subjective judgements of the inspectors. This study proposes an automated approach to detect and segment cracks in high-resolution images. An end-to-end cascaded framework is proposed to first detect the existence of cracks using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and then segment the crack using a modified U-Net encoder-decoder architecture. A Naïve Bayes data fusion scheme is proposed to reduce the false positives and false negatives effectively. To generate the binary crack mask, first, the original images are divided into 448 × 448 overlapping image patches where these image patches are classified as cracks versus non-cracks using a deep CNN. Next, a modified U-Net is trained from scratch using only the crack patches for segmentation. A customized loss function that consists of binary cross entropy loss and the Dice loss is introduced to enhance the segmentation performance. Additionally, a Naïve Bayes fusion strategy is employed to integrate the crack score maps from different overlapping crack patches and to decide whether a pixel is crack or not. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves an 81.71% mean intersection over union (mIoU) score across 5 different training/test splits, which is 7.29% higher than the baseline reference implemented with the original U-Net.	https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202208149255781.page	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial

As a viable alternative, researchers in the past resorted to deep learning-based autonomous damage detection algorithms for expedited post-disaster reconnaissance of structures. Although a number of automatic damage detection algorithms have been proposed, the scarcity of labeled training data remains a major concern. To address this issue, this study proposed a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework based on consistency regularization and cross-supervision. Image data from post-earthquake reconnaissance, that contains cracks, spalling, and exposed rebars are used to evaluate the proposed solution. Experiments are carried out under different data partition protocols, and it is shown that the proposed SSL method can make use of unlabeled images to enhance the segmentation performance when limited amount of ground truth labels are provided. This study also proposes DeepLab-AASPP and modified versions of U-Net++ based on channel-wise attention mechanism to better segment the components and damage areas from images of reinforced concrete buildings. The channel-wise attention mechanism can effectively improve the performance of the network by dynamically scaling the feature maps so that the networks can focus on more informative feature maps in the concatenation layer. The proposed DeepLab-AASPP achieves the best performance on component segmentation and damage state segmentation tasks with mIoU scores of 0.9850 and 0.7032, respectively. For crack, spalling, and rebar segmentation tasks, modified U-Net++ obtains the best performance with IoU scores (excluding the background pixels) of 0.5449, 0.9375, and 0.5018, respectively. The proposed architectures win the second place in IC-SHM2021 competition in all five tasks of Project 2.		Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial

Periodic inspection of bridges to identify damages can aid in their quick remediation. Likewise, identifying components can provide context for damage assessment and help gauge a bridge’s state of interaction with its surroundings. Current inspection techniques rely on manual site visits, which can be time-consuming and costly. More recently, robotic inspection assisted by autonomous data analytics based on Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been viewed as a suitable alternative to manual inspection because of its efficiency and accuracy. To aid research in this avenue, this study performs a comparative assessment of different architectures, loss functions, and ensembling strategies for the autonomous segmentation of bridge components and damages. The experiments lead to several interesting discoveries. Nested Reg-UNet architecture is found to outperform five other state-of-the-art architectures in both damage and component segmentation tasks. The architecture is built by combining a Nested UNet style dense configuration with a pretrained RegNet encoder. In terms of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, the Nested Reg-UNet architecture provides an improvement of 2.86% on the damage segmentation task and 1.66% on the component segmentation task compared to the state-of-the-art UNet architecture. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that incorporating the Lovasz-Softmax loss function to counter class imbalance can boost performance by 3.44% in the component segmentation task over the most employed alternative, weighted Cross Entropy (wCE). Finally, weighted softmax ensembling is found to be quite effective when used synchronously with the Nested Reg-UNet architecture by providing mIoU improvement of 0.74% in the component segmentation task and 1.14% in the damage segmentation task over a single-architecture baseline. Overall, the best mIoU of 92.50% for the component segmentation task and 84.19% for the damage segmentation task validate the feasibility of these techniques for autonomous bridge component and damage segmentation using RGB images.

In this context, swarms of autonomous inspection robots, which can replace current manual inspections, are examples of edge devices. Incorporation of pretrained deep learning algorithms into these robots for autonomous damage detection is a challenging problem since these devices are typically limited in computing and memory resources. This study introduces a solution based on network pruning using Taylor expansion to utilize pretrained deep convolutional neural networks for efficient edge computing and incorporation into inspection robots. Results from comprehensive experiments on two pretrained networks (i.e., VGG16 and ResNet18) and two types of prevalent surface defects (i.e., crack and corrosion) are presented and discussed in detail with respect to performance, memory demands, and the inference time for damage detection. It is shown that the proposed approach significantly enhances resource efficiency without decreasing damage detection performance.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mice.12449	Rih-Teng Wu	Resource
