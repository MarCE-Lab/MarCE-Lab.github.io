However, the development of an efficient design methodology still remains challenging due to highly intensive search in the design space required by the conventional optimization-based approaches. To address this issue, this study develops two machine learning (ML)-based approaches for the design of one-dimensional periodic and non-periodic metamaterial systems. For periodic metamaterials, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach is proposed to design a metamaterial that can achieve user-defined frequency band gaps. This RL-based approach surpasses conventional optimization-based methods in the reduction of computation cost when a near-optimal solution is acceptable. Leveraging the capability of exploration in RL, the proposed approach does not require any training datasets generation and therefore can be deployed for online metamaterial design. For non-periodic metamaterials, a neural network (NN)-based approach capable of learning the behavior of individual material units is presented. By assembling the NN representation of individual material units, a surrogate model of the whole metamaterial is employed to determine the properties of the resulting assembly. Interestingly, the proposed approach is capable of modeling different metamaterial assemblies satisfying user-defined properties while requiring only a one-time network training procedure. Also, the NN-based approach does not need a pre-defined number of material unit cells, and it works when the physical model of the unit cell is not well understood, or the situation where only the sensor measurements of the unit cell are available. The robustness of the proposed two approaches is validated through numerical simulations and design examples.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-020-02819-6	Rih-Teng Wu	Metamaterial
research_image/m2.webp	A physics-constrained deep learning based approach for acoustic inverse scattering problems	The control of acoustic and elastic waves via engineered materials has several important real-world applications such as non-destructive evaluation of structural components, synthesis of biomedical devices, high-resolution imaging, and remote sensing. Being formulated as inverse problems, all these applications share as a common denominator the need for efficient solution methodologies. Available techniques, mostly based on conventional optimization approaches, have shown some significant limitations in terms of the ability to explore a vast design space and to limit the computation burden. In this study, a novel deep auto-encoder (DAE) based approach is proposed in order to solve a benchmark inverse problem consisting in designing assemblies of acoustic scattering elements capable of molding an incoming plane wave into a target (user-defined) downstream pressure distribution. The proposed approach is validated numerically through three design scenarios, involving either a single or multiple scatterer configuration, and target pressure fields defined at different frequencies. The proposed network consists of a geometry estimator and a DAE that imposes constraints due to the physics of the problem on the geometry estimator during the learning process which leads to more robust design. By joint optimization, the estimation of scatterer geometry is strengthened with the latent representations of the target pressure field learned by the DAE. For a trained network, the design inference is quasi-instantaneous given a target 2D pressure field. The generalization capability of the proposed network is further explored by using a dataset generated based on scatterers having new shapes.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327021005665	Rih-Teng Wu	Metamaterial
research_image/m1.webp	Deep-learning-based acoustic metamaterial design for attenuating structure-borne noise in auditory frequency bands	In engineering acoustics, the propagation of elastic flexural waves in plate and shell structures is a common transmission path of vibrations and structure-borne noises. Phononic metamaterials with a frequency band gap can effectively block elastic waves in certain frequency ranges, but often require a tedious trial-and-error design process. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competence in solving various inverse problems. This study proposes a deeplearning-based workflow for phononic plate metamaterial design. The Mindlin plate formulation was used to expedite the forward calculations, and the neural network was trained for inverse design. We showed that, with only 360 sets of data for training and testing, the neural network attained a 2% error in achieving the target band gap, by optimizing five design parameters. The designed metamaterial plate showed a -1 dB/mm omnidirectional attenuation for flexural waves around 3 kHz.	https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/5/1879	Rih-Teng Wu	Metamaterial
research_image/A6.webp	A texture‐based video processing methodology using Bayesian data fusion for autonomous crack detection on metallic	Regular inspection of the components of nuclear power plants is important to improve their resilience. However, current inspection practices are time consuming, tedious, and subjective: they involve an operator manually locating cracks in metallic surfaces in the plant by watching videos. At the same time, prevalent automatic crack detection algorithms may not detect cracks in metallic surfaces because these are typically very small and have low contrast. Moreover, the existences of scratches, welds, and grind marks lead to a large number of false positives when state-of-the-art vision based crack detection algorithms are used. In this study, a novel crack detection approach is proposed based on local binary patterns (LBP), support vector machine (SVM), and Bayesian decision theory. The proposed method aggregates the information obtained from different video frames to enhance the robustness and reliability of detection. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed by using several inspection videos. The results indicate that it is accurate and robust in cases where state-of-the-art crack detection approaches fail. The experiments show that Bayesian data fusion improves the hit rate by 20% and the hit rate achieves 85% with only one false positive per frame.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mice.12256	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial
research_image/A5.webp	Deep convolutional neural network for structural dynamic response estimation and system identification	This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach to estimate the dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, a nonlinear SDOF system, and a full-scale 3-story multidegree of freedom (MDOF) steel frame. In the MDOF system, roof acceleration is estimated through the input ground motion. Various cases of noise-contaminated signals are considered in this study, and the conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm serves as a reference for the proposed CNN approach. According to the results from numerical simulations and experimental data, the proposed CNN approach is able to predict the structural responses accurately, and it is more robust against noisy data compared with the MLP algorithm. Moreover, the physical interpretation of CNN model is discussed in the context of structural dynamics. It is demonstrated that in some special cases, the convolution kernel has the capability of approximating the numerical integration operator, and the convolution layers attempt to extract the dominant frequency signature observed in the ideal target signal while eliminating irrelevant information during the training process.	https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29EM.1943-7889.0001556	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial
research_image/A4.webp	Deep learning-based multi-class damage detection for autonomous post-disaster reconnaissance	Timely assessment of damages induced to buildings due to an earthquake is critical for ensuring life safety, mitigating financial losses, and expediting the rehabilitation process as well as enhancing the structural resilience where resilience is measured by an infrastructure's capacity to restore full functionality post extreme events. Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes façade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.	 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/stc.2507	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial
research_image/A3.webp	Crack segmentation in high-resolution images using cascaded deep convolutional neural networks and Bayesian data fusion	Manual inspection of steel box girders on long span bridges is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The quality of inspection relies on the subjective judgements of the inspectors. This study proposes an automated approach to detect and segment cracks in high-resolution images. An end-to-end cascaded framework is proposed to first detect the existence of cracks using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and then segment the crack using a modified U-Net encoder-decoder architecture. A Naïve Bayes data fusion scheme is proposed to reduce the false positives and false negatives effectively. To generate the binary crack mask, first, the original images are divided into 448 × 448 overlapping image patches where these image patches are classified as cracks versus non-cracks using a deep CNN. Next, a modified U-Net is trained from scratch using only the crack patches for segmentation. A customized loss function that consists of binary cross entropy loss and the Dice loss is introduced to enhance the segmentation performance. Additionally, a Naïve Bayes fusion strategy is employed to integrate the crack score maps from different overlapping crack patches and to decide whether a pixel is crack or not. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves an 81.71% mean intersection over union (mIoU) score across 5 different training/test splits, which is 7.29% higher than the baseline reference implemented with the original U-Net.	https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202208149255781.page	Rih-Teng Wu	Artificial
research_image/A2.webp	Deep learning-based autonomous post-disaster building reconnaissance leveraging channel-wise attention and semi-supervised learning	The existing vision-based techniques for inspection and condition assessment of civil infrastructure are mostly manual and consequently time-consuming, expensive, subjective, and risky. As a viable alternative, researchers in the past resorted to deep learning-based autonomous damage detection algorithms for expedited post-disaster reconnaissance of structures. Although a number of automatic damage detection algorithms have been proposed, the scarcity of labeled training data remains a major concern. To address this issue, this study proposed a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework based on consistency regularization and cross-supervision. Image data from post-earthquake reconnaissance, that contains cracks, spalling, and exposed rebars are used to evaluate the proposed solution. Experiments are carried out under different data partition protocols, and it is shown that the proposed SSL method can make use of unlabeled images to enhance the segmentation performance when limited amount of ground truth labels are provided. This study also proposes DeepLab-AASPP and modified versions of U-Net++ based on channel-wise attention mechanism to better segment the components and damage areas from images of reinforced concrete buildings. The channel-wise attention mechanism can effectively improve the performance of the network by dynamically scaling the feature maps so that the networks can focus on more informative feature maps in the concatenation layer. The proposed DeepLab-AASPP achieves the best performance on component segmentation and damage state segmentation tasks with mIoU scores of 0.9850 and 0.7032, respectively. For crack, spalling, and rebar segmentation tasks, modified U-Net++ obtains the best performance with IoU scores (excluding the background pixels) of 0.5449, 0.9375, and 0.5018, respectively. The proposed architectures win the second place in IC-SHM2021 competition in all five tasks of Project 2.		Rih-Teng Wu	Resource
research_image/A1.webp	Ensemble-based deep learning for autonomous bridge component and damage segmentation leveraging Nested Reg-UNet	Bridges constantly undergo deterioration and damage, the most common ones being concrete damage and exposed rebar. Periodic inspection of bridges to identify damages can aid in their quick remediation. Likewise, identifying components can provide context for damage assessment and help gauge a bridge’s state of interaction with its surroundings. Current inspection techniques rely on manual site visits, which can be time-consuming and costly. More recently, robotic inspection assisted by autonomous data analytics based on Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been viewed as a suitable alternative to manual inspection because of its efficiency and accuracy. To aid research in this avenue, this study performs a comparative assessment of different architectures, loss functions, and ensembling strategies for the autonomous segmentation of bridge components and damages. The experiments lead to several interesting discoveries. Nested Reg-UNet architecture is found to outperform five other state-of-the-art architectures in both damage and component segmentation tasks. The architecture is built by combining a Nested UNet style dense configuration with a pretrained RegNet encoder. In terms of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, the Nested Reg-UNet architecture provides an improvement of 2.86% on the damage segmentation task and 1.66% on the component segmentation task compared to the state-of-the-art UNet architecture. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that incorporating the Lovasz-Softmax loss function to counter class imbalance can boost performance by 3.44% in the component segmentation task over the most employed alternative, weighted Cross Entropy (wCE). Finally, weighted softmax ensembling is found to be quite effective when used synchronously with the Nested Reg-UNet architecture by providing mIoU improvement of 0.74% in the component segmentation task and 1.14% in the damage segmentation task over a single-architecture baseline. Overall, the best mIoU of 92.50% for the component segmentation task and 84.19% for the damage segmentation task validate the feasibility of these techniques for autonomous bridge component and damage segmentation using RGB images.

research_image/r1.webp	Pruning deep convolutional neural networks for efficient edge computing in condition assessment of infrastructures	Health monitoring of civil infrastructures is a key application of Internet of things (IoT), while edge computing is an important component of IoT. In this context, swarms of autonomous inspection robots, which can replace current manual inspections, are examples of edge devices. Incorporation of pretrained deep learning algorithms into these robots for autonomous damage detection is a challenging problem since these devices are typically limited in computing and memory resources. This study introduces a solution based on network pruning using Taylor expansion to utilize pretrained deep convolutional neural networks for efficient edge computing and incorporation into inspection robots. Results from comprehensive experiments on two pretrained networks (i.e., VGG16 and ResNet18) and two types of prevalent surface defects (i.e., crack and corrosion) are presented and discussed in detail with respect to performance, memory demands, and the inference time for damage detection. It is shown that the proposed approach significantly enhances resource efficiency without decreasing damage detection performance.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mice.12449	Rih-Teng Wu	Resource
research_image/tingyan.webp	Development of a high-fidelity failure prediction system for reinforced concrete bridge columns using generative adversarial networks	Visual damage patterns of structural components are critical to evaluate structural performance. However, visual damage images can only be obtained by laboratory tests or in-situ tests, which require massive funding and human workforces. In this study, a novel bridge column failure prediction framework is proposed based on generative adversarial network (GAN). Trained with merely 110 damage patterns collected from experimental cyclic loading test, the proposed approach predicts the high-fidelity surface damage patterns of concrete bridge columns given the information of the column design parameters as well as the user-desirable performance level, i.e., Damage Index (DI) of the column. Two network architectures and three label encoding strategies are explored to investigate the performance in estimating the damage pattern. By incorporating DI as a numerical label, the proposed network is able to predict the unseen damage patterns which are not available in the training dataset. Also, it is found that adding classifiers and regressors in the discriminator to account for the condition vector is beneficial for network training, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 102.6 when producing the synthetic patterns. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed framework is capable of synthesizing decent damage patterns with superior fidelity, providing bridge engineers with a platform to evaluate the potential failure modes during seismic design and evaluation.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029623005448#fig7	Ting-Yan Wu	Artificial
research_image/adrian.webp	Building manufacturing deep learning models with minimal and imbalanced training data using domain adaptation and data augmentation.	Deep learning (DL) techniques are highly effective for defect detection from images. Training DL classification models, however, requires vast amounts of labeled data which is often expensive to collect. In many cases, not only the available training data is limited but may also imbalanced. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation (DA) approach to address the problem of labeled training data scarcity for a target learning task by transferring knowledge gained from an existing source dataset used for a similar learning task. Our approach works for scenarios where the source dataset and the dataset available for the target learning task have same or different feature spaces. We combine our DA approach with an autoencoder-based data augmentation approach to address the problem of imbalanced target datasets. We evaluate our combined approach using image data for wafer defect prediction. The experiments show its superior performance against other algorithms when the number of labeled samples in the target dataset is significantly small and the target dataset is imbalanced.	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143099	Adrian Shuai Li	Resource
research_image/yichang.webp	Multi-task deep learning for crack segmentation and quantification in RC structures	Crack width is frequently used for damage assessment in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Recently, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed for crack detection and segmentation. However, most of them focus on extracting the crack regions, followed by width calculation using conventional methods. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task DL model to predict crack segmentation and crack centerline simultaneously. Effects of loss functions are investigated, and state-of-the-art segmentation models are employed as baselines. Results show that the proposed multi-task U-Net model enhances the estimation in crack centerline and outperforms the baselines by more than 2% in width quantification. Moreover, we propose a computer vision (CV) based approach to calculate crack width when camera shooting angle is not perpendicular to target surface. 3D reconstruction and plane fitting are incorporated to correct distortion, and images obtained from non-vertical capturing are used to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580524003352#f0025	Yi-Chang Chen	Artificial
research_image/TzuKang.webp	Damage Scenario Prediction for Concrete Bridge Columns Using Deep Generative Networks	Bridges in areas with high seismic risk are constantly exposed to earthquake threats. Therefore, comprehensive bridge damage assessments are essential for postearthquake retrofitting and safety assurance. However, traditional methods of assessing damage and collecting data are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach to predict the surface damage patterns of bridge columns. Using visual patterns from experimental tests, the proposed approach can generate surface damage to the synthetic column, such as cracks and concrete splinters. The study also investigates the effects of different data representation schemes, such as grayscale, black and white, and obstacle-removed images, and uses the corresponding damage indices as additional constraints to improve network training. The results show that the proposed approach can offer a reliable reference for bridge engineers to evaluate and repair seismic-induced bridge damage, which can significantly lower the cost of disaster reconnaissance.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5526537	Tzu-Kang Lin	Artificial
research_image/HaiWei.webp	Unsupervised anomaly detection for tile spalling segmentation using synthetic outlier exposure and contrastive learning	Tile spalling poses significant threats to pedestrians on sidewalks. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been developed for autonomous building assessments. However, training a supervised model typically requires a large labeled dataset, which is often unavailable in new domain tasks. Moreover, data acquisition and ground-truth labeling are costly. This paper presents an unsupervised framework for anomaly detection of tile spalling. The framework incorporates uncertainty estimation and contrastive learning by training a segmentation model on a source dataset containing known classes, excluding spalling. Spalling is subsequently identified as outlier pixels based on elevated uncertainty scores. Additionally, a synthetic pattern, dubbed “Spalling Craft”, is developed for outlier exposure to further enhance model performance. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by approximately 18.4%, 46.6%, and 31.7% in AUC, AP, and FPR95 scores, respectively. Compared to supervised learning methods, the framework significantly improves data efficiency while achieving strong performance in tile spalling segmentation.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580524006770	Hai-Wei Wang	Resource
research_image/TingYan2.webp	Physics-guided GAN-based prognostic framework for seismic hysteresis loop and damage pattern in RC bridge columns	Hysteretic behavior, damage patterns, and structural performance, e.g., Damage index (DI), are the critical seismic characteristic of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge columns. In this study, a novel bridge seismic hysteresis loop and damage pattern prognostic framework is proposed, including a sequence-to-sequence hysteresis prediction network based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and a damage pattern generative model based on a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), namely HysGRU and HysGAN, respectively. Through training on 160 hysteresis loops, the physics-guided HysGRU model, which incorporates constraints derived from numerical simulation, achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 47.57 kN and an score of 94.55%. This represents substantial improvements over purely simulation, with a 63.53% reduction in RMSE and a 35.56% increase in score, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating physics-based constraints into the deep learning framework. Moreover, the physics features of hysteretic behavior are extracted as a condition of HysGAN. To evaluate the performance of HysGAN, a pre-trained DI prediction network is adopted to calculate the scores from the DI values prediction of the predicted damage patterns. Extensive experiments have shown that conditioning with latent features can improve quality, stability, and generalization capability. HysGAN achieves scores of 91.65% and 91.62% on validation and test datasets, significantly improving over the baseline model with increases of 4.68% and 54.62%, respectively. Upon completion of the model training process, engineers can automatically derive the hysteresis loop and damage patterns given specific column design parameters and selected drift ratios with the proposed HysGRU and HysGAN, facilitating an efficient assessment of seismic design and capacity.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029625000586	Ting-Yan Wu	Artificial
