CIE2006	Mechanics of Materials	This course introduces the basic concepts/principles of engineering mechanics, with a focus on the mechanics of materials. Prerequisites include statics, dynamics and calculus. To develop analytical techniques of mechanics of materials, this course will rely on students’ prerequisite knowledge of mathematics and basic science. However, exemptions of no prerequisites being taken may be allowed under special circumstances. Upon taking this course, students will learn the constitutive law of materials, and the behavior of axial member, beam and column, subjected to different types of external loads including axial force, torsion, bending moment and shear force. As an engineer, it is essential to understand the theoretical developments of analysis tools for the internal forces and deformations when a component of structure (e.g., bridge and building) experiencing external loads, in order to select the appropriate materials and design the dimension/shape of the component accordingly. This course will start with the introduction of common material properties (e.g., Young’s modulus, yielding strength, residual strain), the definition of stress and strain, followed by the mechanics of axial members, beam and column. Course materials may be slightly adjusted depending on the progress of the classes. Grading will be based on the attendance, assignments, quiz, midterm and final exam.
CIE1011	Physical Model Design Laboratory	The main purpose of this course is to allow students to explore the advantages and disadvantages of shapes, materials and production methods in the context of only drawing ability (AutoCAD) but no other professional knowledge skills; : metal or kaolin) and tools (e.g. manual and computer-aided) to design and make a viable model of structures (e.g. buildings, bridges, towers and domes) and equipment models (e.g. submersible shields or Water sluice gate), and then use laboratory test equipment to test the performance of the physical model.
CIE5151	Deep Learning in Computer Vision	This course introduces the fundamental theory/background knowledge of prevalent machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) algorithms. Relevant applications in the broad domain of the engineering community will be introduced to motivate the students. The first half of the semester will focus on the reasoning of artificial intelligence, several ML algorithms, model evaluation, deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning. The rest of the semester will have emphasis on the reasoning of image processing, image feature extractions and pairing, as well as image-based sensing. After taking this course, students are expected to be equipped with basic knowledge and implementation skills to develop ML, DL or CV based approaches for applications in engineering.
